# Pixelversi

**Pixelversi** is a modern, retro-inspired take on the classic game of Reversi (Othello), built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Battle the AI, challenge a friend locally, or just vibe out to the pixel aesthetics and CRT scanlines!

- **Animated piece flips** – enjoy satisfying, smooth transitions as the board changes

- **New Game & color selection** – switch sides or restart any time
